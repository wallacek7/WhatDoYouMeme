# WhatDoYouMeme
In-class project
My name is Kayla Wallace. I got my bachelor's degree in International Relations from Syracuse University and prior to starting the computer science program here at SUNY New Paltz, I had little to no experience in the computer science field. The past Computer Science classes I have taken are: Database Design, Programming & Data Structures, Programming Languages, Algorithms for Cryptography & Security, & Database Management. I am currently enrolled in: Computer Systems, Web Server Programming, & Cloud Computing. The only programming language that I have considerable experiencce with is Java which I learned in this Master's degree program. I have prior experience with HTML/CSS from years ago when I had an interest in web page design however that knowledge was all self-taught and is pretty basic.
I hope to use what I learn in this class in a variety of different ways. Not only do I want to use what I will learn here to enrich projects/assignments in other classes, but I genuinely believe that the skills I will learn here are neccesary to have in order to obtain a decent job in the computer science profession. I have never used GitHub or GitKraken before however I am hoping to continue using them beyond this class and way into my future. I do have a lot to learn but I have no doubt that what I will learn will be extremely valuable to me.
